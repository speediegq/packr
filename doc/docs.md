packr
=====

Packr is a concept (that is, work in progress) "hybrid" package manager for
GNU/Linux. This means it can be used to both install packages by compiling them
on the user's system, and install precompiled binaries created by other users like yourself,
both through local packages and through repositories.

## Usage

packr supports installation and removal of packages.
